about_content: |
  I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester, as part of the 
  [Neuro-Symbolic AI Group](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/neuro-symbolic-ai).
  
  My research focuses on investigating AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), 
  to perform Natural Language Inference in the clinical domain, including tasks like 
  retrieving and ranking clinical trials for patients and classifying clinical trial protocol deviations. A key aspect of my work is designing hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures that are both explainable, and 
  integrated with ground knowledge, such as ontologies, for improved robustness, efficiency, and controllability. 
  Additionally, working to uncover inference mechanisms and limitations of LLMs.

        description: |
          Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in NLP tasks but face challenges in shortcut learning, factual inconsistency, and vulnerability to adversarial inputs. This is especially problematic in medical contexts, where such limitations can misrepresent actual model capabilities. This paper introduces SemEval-2024 Task 2: Safe Biomedical Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trials. The task presents the refined NLI4CT-P dataset, designed to test LLMs on interventional and causal reasoning in clinical trials, and includes a comprehensive evaluation of over 1200 submissions from 106 participants. The goal is to enhance the robustness and applicability of NLI models in healthcare. The dataset, leaderboard, and website are publicly available.
