about_content: |
  I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester, 
  part of the [Neuro-Symbolic AI Group](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/neuro-symbolic-ai).
  
  My research focuses on investigating AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), 
  to perform Natural Language Inference in the clinical domain, including tasks like 
  retrieving and ranking clinical trials for patients and classifying clinical trial protocol deviations. A key aspect of my work is designing hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures that are both explainable, and 
  integrated with ground knowledge, such as ontologies, for improved robustness, efficiency, and controllability. 
  Additionally, working to uncover inference mechanisms and limitations of LLMs.

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
