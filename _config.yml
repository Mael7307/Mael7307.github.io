about_content: |
  I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester, as part of the 
  [Neuro-Symbolic AI Group](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/neuro-symbolic-ai).
  
  My research focuses on investigating AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), 
  to perform Natural Language Inference in the clinical domain, including tasks like 
  retrieving and ranking clinical trials for patients and classifying clinical trial protocol deviations. A key aspect of my work is designing hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures that are both explainable, and 
  integrated with ground knowledge, such as ontologies, for improved robustness, efficiency, and controllability. 
  Additionally, working to uncover inference mechanisms and limitations of LLMs.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my MSc, I developed a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on key areas such as convolutional neural networks. My dissertation work centered on applying AI to the clinical domain, which has been pivotal in shaping my research direction.

          Thesis: "Convolutional Neural Networks for Audio Classification" 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my BSc, I honed my mathematical reasoning and problem-solving skills, which laid the groundwork for my transition into AI and computational research. My studies included a deep dive into algebra, calculus, and statistics, which have proven essential in my current research.
